# CapstoneProject
 This project is an Inventory Management API using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). This API will enable users to manage inventory items by adding, updating, deleting, and viewing inventory levels. The API will support user authentication and inventory tracking, simulating a real-world inventory management system for a store.
